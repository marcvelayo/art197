My interdisciplinary work spans photo, drawing, installation, and performance. Often working in large-scale doodle drawing-based installations and time-lapse video, my work explores themes of anxiety and self-awareness. 2020 has been an eventful year and it inspired me to visualize my thoughts and emotions by doodling into various types of canvases.
<p>
My daily walk outdoors highly influenced my first project called Wrapped Thoughts. I started this project with a durational journal about my interactions with nature and the thoughts I&#39;ve pondered on while walking. My mental health wasn&#39;t at its best when the quarantine period started. I felt various emotions-- from being sad to being extremely lethargic. I lost my passion in creation, but independently going outdoors has helped me achieve a healthier state of mind. Through my daily walks, I gained a better sense of understanding of who I am and what I can do during this pandemic. Nature calmed my anxiety and helped me conquer the bits and pieces of negativity that inhabited my mind. These thoughts and realizations are then visualized through the doodles I created on Wrapped Thoughts. I used a cloth as my canvas and black sharpie markers for the doodles. I decided to use a cloth as a canvas, so I can wrap it around myself as the final piece. This idea inspired the title, &#39;Wrapped Thoughts&#39;. I wanted to see myself, wrapped in a cloth full of ideas, thoughts and emotions I&#39;ve felt throughout the days I&#39;ve spent during the pandemic.
<p>
My ideas surrounding my connection with nature evolved in my second project called Transparent Thoughts. I used a clear plastic canvas and placed my camera directly in front to show my creative process of doodling. Transparent Thoughts, pt. 1 was created at Ullistac Natural Area in Santa Clara. Being surrounded by nature created an immersive experience that provided me direction in my style and composition. The harsh breeze that I felt during that time created extreme frustration and annoyance for me-- thus ending up with a piece that resembled the air&#39;s playful movement. 
<p>
One&#39;s thoughts aren&#39;t always optimistic and organized. Transparent Thoughts, pt. 2 showcases the visual representations of what my mind looks like during a tough time-- chaotic and erratic. The video displays various days of my process, sketching out emotions I&#39;ve felt during the durational process. From feeling optimistic after a walk at a park, reminiscing the holidays I&#39;ve spent in my homeland to words of affirmation written for me to reflect on-- I wanted to share my vulnerable side. 
<p>
My projects that displayed my thoughts and emotions live comfortably in my head rent-free. But I am no longer letting these thoughts and emotions stay longer. I&#39;m letting go and I&#39;m evicting them through the best way I know--- art. Every thought, scribbled. Every emotion, shaded. My work is about who I was in the past, what I feel in the present and who I want to be in the future.
